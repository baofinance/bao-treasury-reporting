# bao-treasury-reporting

Bao Treasury Script is collecting assets values from the different assets and LP tokens in the treasury addresses. It takes a csv file as an input to browse all the ERC20 token addresses in order to check the balance of those tokens in the wallet. The output gives the value of each asset in a CSV file for reporting.
